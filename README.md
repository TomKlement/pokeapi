This application is built with React and TypeScript, using the PokéAPI to fetch and display Pokémon data. It implements lazy loading of Pokémon details, infinite scrolling for efficient data rendering, and a search feature to quickly filter Pokémon by name. Pokémon details (types, moves, abilities) are cached to minimize API calls, providing a smooth user experience even when dealing with large datasets.
